The original post can be found on here: [Page transition with using uGUI and UniRx](http://qiita.com/lycoris102/items/1c792c4ba78e564a1b21)

Requirement

* [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx)
* [DoTween](https://github.com/Demigiant/dotween)


## Getting UniRx How

Note UniRx is diffrent repository. Pulling other Unity project into another Unity project with submodul or subtree of git is a bit hard. Instead of using submodule or subtree, tried to get UniRx into this repository as the following instruction:

* [Merge a subdirectory of another repository with git](https://bneijt.nl/blog/post/merge-a-subdirectory-of-another-repository-with-git/)

Much better than using submodule or subtree, even it can be possible to pull any subdirectory under a Unity's Assets folder.
